nice.  the ipositivehone mail apositivepositive sound effects match os x's mail apositivepositive sound effects.  the impositiveressive is in the details.
Trying to get ipositivehone to respositiveond to OS X services. There must be a crack in this thing somewhere.

@thephillyman Both. Need OS X virtualpc to do iPhone apps.
All of a sudden my iPhone will only get 169.254.x.x IPs from my home LAN (dual band airport N/G network). Worked fine before yesterday. Qua?
@philcampbell they couldnt do it with sdk - they would need help from apple - but iphone runs mac os x and flash runs on osx so its doable
"@v1b thanks but I need to find an iPhone webapp, a mac os X widget."
"Apple is smart to push Exchange support on the iPhone, but I wish they would beef up their own OS X Server + Postfix enterprise solution."
It's at these times that I secretly wish Apple would apply iPhone-like controls to 3rd party app distribution on OS X as well. am i bad?
I have a Palm T|X ... would like an iPhone but it costs too much...wondering what I should wait for-- iTouch?
