"trying to get my ipositivehone to remember my home network. There doesn't seem to be a ""positivereferred Networks"" feature like Mac OS X."
kind of hate having to expositivelicitly hit the little x when ipositivehone guesses wrong
nice.  the ipositivehone mail apositivepositive sound effects match os x's mail apositivepositive sound effects.  the impositiveressive is in the details.
Trying to get ipositivehone to respositiveond to OS X services. There must be a crack in this thing somewhere.
I love that my ipositivehone has os X sounds for email. feels like home.

@thephillyman Both. Need OS X virtualpc to do iPhone apps.
All of a sudden my iPhone will only get 169.254.x.x IPs from my home LAN (dual band airport N/G network). Worked fine before yesterday. Qua?
@philcampbell they couldnt do it with sdk - they would need help from apple - but iphone runs mac os x and flash runs on osx so its doable
"@v1b thanks but I need to find an iPhone webapp, a mac os X widget."
"Apple is smart to push Exchange support on the iPhone, but I wish they would beef up their own OS X Server + Postfix enterprise solution."
It's at these times that I secretly wish Apple would apply iPhone-like controls to 3rd party app distribution on OS X as well. am i bad?
I have a Palm T|X ... would like an iPhone but it costs too much...wondering what I should wait for-- iTouch?
"still wondering why the iPhone has better folder icons than OS X Leopard. Love me those metallic folders in Safari Touch bookmarks, yumyum."
Friend says and I agree: I wish Apple would make their YouTube app for the iPhone available normal Mac OS X. [We hate flash video stutter.]
"Still, still! I'm having Leopard problems. Airport drops and fluctuates. Tiger boxes are fine. Looks like iPhone drained the OS X brain."
Realizing that Silverlight could fail if it doesn't run everywhere... like on the iPhone / iPod touch. Or not run well on OS X and Linux...
"CSS animations in Safari 3 (+iPhone 2.x?) Like old IE transform/transitions, could save time, potentially nice if standardized. We'll see."
"i hate you iphone. because i have to click close on so many txt's before i can end call, my calls always end up as x:01 - x:04, such a waste"
I think @slowgardening is going to like her iPhone which promises richer interop with Exchange than Outlook Web Access (fingers x'd)
"loves Apple. Man. iPhone, Macbook Air, OS X... epic win. I wonder when they'll have new Cinema Displays though, I want one with a camera."
Up way too late playing with Smart Scroll X - Why isn't this part of OS X? It's iphone scrolling for your portable and desktop.. its awesome
ZiPhone = awesome. One-click jailbreak and/or unlock from any 1.1.x iPhone firmware.
"Oh well. There is no silence app for the iphone. I guess I'll go with X Los Angeles. Music is good, sometimes I just need silence to design."
"Testing out Smart Scroll X. So far, it's awesome! It really feels like the iPhone scrolling."

@dmotion haha you're gonna crash the sms gateway. iPhone keeps replacing dmotion with emotion. It np like d :x
"I'd probably buy a new newotn-basically a newton with a colour screen and silver casing, and with iPhone OS X on it, that would be cool...."
@GlennF â€” I didn't find the move from MT 3.x to MT 4 to be that big a deal at all. Well worth it for the iPhone web interface alone.
Wish I could use Seesmic on my iPhone. Bored waiting for os x to finish up installing.
"iPhoneHellas has an awesome tool! A small card that attaches to you SIM and tells the phone (iPhone i.e.) that it is from provider ""X""..."
"@tommorris I have a remedy: buy train operators' shares. Anyway, is Netbeans any good?  @boagworld Does OS X 1.1.3 comes with iPhone SDK?"
@mgonzalvez might be. wondering if we can get something like the iPhone Mac OS X version
"@thattalldude  same for the rest of the mac community, we want an #Apple made mac tablet, touchscreen like #iPhone, full OS X features"
I need a password manager on Mac OS X (replacing SplashID) - key would be one with an iPhone solution that is not hosted or otherwise shared
Hrm.  Bad OS X installers stick icons on dock.  Will bad iPhone installers insert app icons on the home screen or will they have to behave?
"apple should give their iphone/itouch versions of os x housecat names, like tuxedo, ragdoll, siameseâ€¦"
"I want an iphone

"@ravbaker: just open ""about:config"", create a string ""general.useragent.override"" and paste ""Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU like Mac OS X;  ..."
"As of Leopard, Mac OS X remembers volume levels when switching between headphones and internal speakers. Just like the iPhone."
In the line to get my iPhone. 5 people ahead. e-x-c-i-i-t-e-d!
I just can't get use to having the touch the autocorrection on the iphone to stop it instead of to choose it even though it has an X on it
WOOO I GOT AN IPHONE! Now if I could just get work to put the right version of os x on it so I can actually activate the thing....
"Wish Mac OS X would let me set my desktop picture iPhone-style, allow me pinch in & out, and move around a bit."

"@ocell - I mixed my Yahoo, gmail, and OS X addressbooks when I got my iPhone. There were a few wrinkles, but it's nice now. Keep backups!!"
"I still like Macs & OS X & my iPhone & iPods, and I'd still recommend all-a that to me friends, but Linux is now my main, starting ... now."
mega chuffed I got wi fi on iPhone working again and finely god Nintendo Ds working too!! woop!!! Apollo Im is not that bad for the iphone x
Rockin' the 1.1.1 and 10.5 - two OS X upgrades in one wknd! Now if only I could get the iPhone to speak german...
hmm iphone doesn't like the word OS X... Restart successful!!! Wow beautifullness.
My OS X version total will go up from 11.4.12 to 11.5.12 soon and 11.6.1 when I get around to updating my iPhone.
Obsessively reading up on the OS X Leopard announcement and tidbits like all the other Mac geeks. See that Notes will sync with the iPhone!
Think I'll finally get around to claiming my iPhone rebate so I can buy OS X Leopard in a couple weeks.
I wish the iPhone came with a port of Mac OS X's Dictionary app.
"@AlexGold Since its running OS X it should be able to port some iPhone apps over, should be easy to get third party apps on too. Cant wait."
"So when are we going to see Silverlight for iPhone? It already works on Mac OS X Safari. Get going, Microsoft, and kick Flash in the butt!"
