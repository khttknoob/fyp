Agog that my, ipositivehone thinks 1 + 1 x 4 equals 5. You're not a scientific calculator so stopositive acting like it!
Using the new ipositiveod, (ipositivehone) feels like moving from OS 9 to OS X
"trying to get my ipositivehone to remember my home network. There doesn't seem to be a ""positivereferred Networks"" feature like Mac OS X."
kind of hate having to expositivelicitly hit the little x when ipositivehone guesses wrong
nice.  the ipositivehone mail apositivepositive sound effects match os x's mail apositivepositive sound effects.  the impositiveressive is in the details.
Trying to get ipositivehone to respositiveond to OS X services. There must be a crack in this thing somewhere.
I love that my ipositivehone has os X sounds for email. feels like home.

@thephillyman Both. Need OS X virtualpc to do iPhone apps.
All of a sudden my iPhone will only get 169.254.x.x IPs from my home LAN (dual band airport N/G network). Worked fine before yesterday. Qua?
@philcampbell they couldnt do it with sdk - they would need help from apple - but iphone runs mac os x and flash runs on osx so its doable
"@v1b thanks but I need to find an iPhone webapp, a mac os X widget."
"Apple is smart to push Exchange support on the iPhone, but I wish they would beef up their own OS X Server + Postfix enterprise solution."
It's at these times that I secretly wish Apple would apply iPhone-like controls to 3rd party app distribution on OS X as well. am i bad?
I have a Palm T|X ... would like an iPhone but it costs too much...wondering what I should wait for-- iTouch?
"still wondering why the iPhone has better folder icons than OS X Leopard. Love me those metallic folders in Safari Touch bookmarks, yumyum."
Friend says and I agree: I wish Apple would make their YouTube app for the iPhone available normal Mac OS X. [We hate flash video stutter.]
"Still, still! I'm having Leopard problems. Airport drops and fluctuates. Tiger boxes are fine. Looks like iPhone drained the OS X brain."
Realizing that Silverlight could fail if it doesn't run everywhere... like on the iPhone / iPod touch. Or not run well on OS X and Linux...
"CSS animations in Safari 3 (+iPhone 2.x?) Like old IE transform/transitions, could save time, potentially nice if standardized. We'll see."
"i hate you iphone. because i have to click close on so many txt's before i can end call, my calls always end up as x:01 - x:04, such a waste"
I think @slowgardening is going to like her iPhone which promises richer interop with Exchange than Outlook Web Access (fingers x'd)
"loves Apple. Man. iPhone, Macbook Air, OS X... epic win. I wonder when they'll have new Cinema Displays though, I want one with a camera."
Up way too late playing with Smart Scroll X - Why isn't this part of OS X? It's iphone scrolling for your portable and desktop.. its awesome
ZiPhone = awesome. One-click jailbreak and/or unlock from any 1.1.x iPhone firmware.
"Oh well. There is no silence app for the iphone. I guess I'll go with X Los Angeles. Music is good, sometimes I just need silence to design."
"Testing out Smart Scroll X. So far, it's awesome! It really feels like the iPhone scrolling."
